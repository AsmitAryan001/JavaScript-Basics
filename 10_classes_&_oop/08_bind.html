<!-- Problem Without bind: In JavaScript, when you pass a method as a callback (like this.handleClick), the context (this) can be lost. By default, when the handleClick method is passed as a callback to the event listener, the value of this inside handleClick would no longer refer to the instance of the React class. Instead, it would refer to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case). This would result in an error when trying to access this.server because this wouldn't be the React instance.

Solution with bind: The bind method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value (this in this case, which refers to the React instance). So by doing this.handleClick.bind(this), you're ensuring that the this inside handleClick will always refer to the React instance, no matter where the function is called from. -->
